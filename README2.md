# Build and install globally
go install ./cmd/anstruct

---

## ‚ö° Quick Start

Experience the power of Anstruct with a few simple commands.

### 1. AI-Powered Generation

Generate an entire project structure from a prompt. Use the --apply flag to create files directly, or omit it to generate a blueprint file first.

# Generate a Go REST API blueprint
anstruct aistruct "golang REST API with PostgreSQL and Docker" -o api.struct

# Generate a React dashboard project directly
anstruct aistruct "react dashboard with routing and tailwind" --apply -o ./dashboard

Tip: Be specific in your prompt for the best results!

### 2. Reverse Engineer & Document

Convert an existing project into a blueprint for documentation, sharing, or modification.

anstruct rstruct ./my-existing-app -o app.struct

### 3. Real-time Watch & Sync

Keep your folder and blueprint in sync during development. This is perfect for ensuring team consistency.

# Two-way sync: folder <-> blueprint
anstruct watch ./myapp ./myapp.struct --full

# One-way sync: blueprint -> folder (safer for production)
anstruct watch ./myapp ./myapp.struct --half struct
